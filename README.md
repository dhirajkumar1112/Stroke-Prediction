# Stroke-Prediction
Stroke prediction using Neural Networks

## Problem Statement
A stroke occurs when the brain gets damaged as a result of interruption of the blood supply. Our task is to predict whether a patient will suffer a stroke or not given the medical data of that patient.

## Data
We used the stroke prediction dataset from Kaggle (uploaded by the user fedesoriano).

## PreProcessing and Model Building
The file for preprocessing and model building named "Stroke_Prediction.ipynb" is uploaded here. 

## Integration
Integration of model is done in python flask
